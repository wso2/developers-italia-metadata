      WSO2 APIM openSource references


      WSO2 API Manager (WSO2 API-M) is a powerful platform for  creating,
      managing, consuming, and monitoring APIs. It combines tried  and tested
      "Syncronous and Asycronous Services Architecture" best  practices with
      modern day API management principles to solve a wide  range of enterprise
      challenges associated with API provisioning,  governance, and integration.


      WSO2 API Manager consists of several loosely coupled modules.


      - API Publisher

      - API Developer Portal

      - API Gateway

      - API Key Manager

      - API Traffic Manager


      The API publisher module allows API publishers to easily define APIs and
      manage them using a strong governance model that consists of
      well-established concepts such as, versioning and lifecycles. API
      consumers can use the API Developer Portal to discover published,
      production-ready APIs and access them in a secure and reliable manner
      using unique API keys. The built-in API Gateway module provides powerful
      tools to secure and control the load on individual APIs.


      WSO2 API Manager is based on the revolutionary WSO2 Carbon  [Middleware a'
      la carte] framework. All the major features have been  developed as
      reusable Carbon components.
